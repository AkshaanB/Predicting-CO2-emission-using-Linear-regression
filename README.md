# Predicting-CO2-emission-using-Linear-regression
This is my first Simple Linear model.
This is an example that was learnt in the lab session of Coursera online course Machine Learning with Python.

## Data set

### Predicting the Co2 emission vs one independent variable
In this model the Co2 emission is predicted with respect to Engine Size.
